# Stock-AI
An attempt to get an RL model to identify trends in stock data. Visit at kennethwang.xyz/stock

# Why?
I wanted to learn how to create machine learning models! My philosophy on learning is that the best way to learn is to create something, and I wanted to create something useful. So I made this!

# Credits
Copilot helped me out here! TensorFlow is very complicated.
